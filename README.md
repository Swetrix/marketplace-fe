## Description

Swetrix Marketplace is a great way to customise Swetrix functionality with extensions.\
You can install community-made or publish your own extensions and get new functionality on Swetrix!

## License

Swetrix is released under the AGPL v3.0 licence, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Install Swetrix

See the API installation process at https://github.com/Swetrix/swetrix-api#readme. \
To selfhost the frontend part of Swetrix, you simply need to set up `.env` variables, install the dependencies (`npm i`), build the code (`npm run build`) and host it as a regular React application ([how to host react apps](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/)).\
On production, swetrix.com uses Cloudflare Pages to host the frontend part of the application.\
The minimum supported NodeJS version is v14.
